1. Gain an overview of DL for music generation.
2. Develop a melody to harmony sequence to sequence model
3. Train the model on matched melody/harmony sequences 
4. Use MicroJam-sourced data as input and see if the generated harmonies make sense!


## Seq-to-Seq Music Generation

{:style="width:75%"}
![](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/music_transformer/motifs_shaded_boxes.png)

1. Understand the Transformer architecture.
2. Implement your own Transformer (e.g., in Keras).
3. Find a musical dataset that could be trained.
4. Train your model, listen to the results and find a way to evaluate them.


## Generating colour palettes from audio data

1. Gain an overview of DL for audio processing.
2. Obtain a dataset of audio and video (or colour) data.
3. Try different neural network designs and evaluate the results. (Even a simple fully-connected ANN might work well!)


## Motion-to-Motion Generators

{:style="width:80%"}

1. Gain an overview of the main DL methods used for motion generation including RNNs, MDRNNs, and world models.
2. Find a dataset of motion capture or other movement data (or capture one yourself!)
3. Train the ANN and evaluate its generative abilities.
