**COMP1720/6720: Art and Interaction Computing:** 

first year elective focussed on creating interactive artworks with computers (`p5.js`). Enrolments from 140-240 per year. Running since ~2005.

**COMP4350/8350: Sound and Music Computing:**

*new* advanced level course focussed on creating collaborative music with computers. Evolved from a "special topic" 2019-2022.

**Major/Minor/Specialisations** in _Human Centred and Creative Computing_. 

New sub-programs to study computing applications in HCI, design, games, music and art.


## Universities in Australia

- ~1.5M university students in Australia (Population: ~25M)
- ~0.5M international students
- international students have a _significant_ affect on Australian society 
- education is [#4 export](https://www.smh.com.au/national/foreign-students-are-our-fourth-largest-export-even-with-the-pandemic-20210218-p573pz.html) industry in Australia 

COVID-19 fallout: ~30% of my students still not attending in-person in Feb 2022 

## University Degrees in Australia

- 3 year undergraduate degrees
- extra (4th) undergrad year is called "Honours"
- some degrees have "integrated honours", e.g., BEng.
- master programs 1-2 years.
- research degrees always (?) called MPhil or PhD---both are 100% research. 2 or 3.5 years.

Computing at ANU: Bachelor of IT (BIT), Bachelor of Adv. Computing (BAC), Master of Computing (MComp), Master of Adv. Computing (MComp Adv.), MPhil, PhD

(evolved from UK system)
