## Universities in Australia

- ~1.5M university students in Australia (Population: ~25M)
- ~0.5M international students
- international students have a _significant_ effect on Australian society 
- education is [#4 export](https://www.smh.com.au/national/foreign-students-are-our-fourth-largest-export-even-with-the-pandemic-20210218-p573pz.html) industry in Australia 

COVID-19 fallout: ~30% of my students still not attending in-person in Feb 2022 

## University Degrees in Australia

- 3 year undergraduate degrees
- extra (4th) undergrad year is called "Honours"
- master programs 1-2 years.
- research degrees: MPhil or PhD.

Computing at ANU: 

- **Bachelor of Adv. Computing (BAC)**, 
- **Master of Computing (MComp)**

## charleslab mission

- Research in music technology, human-centred computing, and creative AI.

- Advance _creative computing_ as an alternative pathway through computing.

- Make _music computing at ANU_ famous in Australia and around the world.
