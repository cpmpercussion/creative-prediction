## Welcome! Great to have you here!

You're now part of a **research lab** (woo hoo!) 

It's a loose network of academics, HDR students, and Master/Undergrad project students!

- Sometimes we have a formal project (e.g., Charles is my supervisor).
- Sometimes we have a collaboration (e.g., I'm working on a paper with Yichen and Charles).
- Sometimes it's part of a job (e.g., I'm a research assistant working for Henry).
- Sometimes we just participate (e.g., I'm going to go to Ben's seminar today to hear about live coding).

## What is this lecture about?

- A brief intro to how work on a project with Charles and others in the lab.

- Expectations: what we expect of you, what you can expect from us.

- Practicalities

- How to plan research

- Guide to weekly activities

- Guide to the "shape" of a project.


## Problems (for Charles): 

- there are (up to) 10 of you and only one of me!

- every student needs some of the same information

- progress on projects is uneven over the semester

- sometimes students don't show up

## Problems (for you):

- you have to define a project, execute it, and write it up! (it's a lot of work - luckily you have 1-2 semesters to do it!)
- you might be new to research (for now!)
- you might not have a lot of background knowledge (yet!)
- research projects are tricky! sometimes ideas don't work out, you have to be flexible but committed to reaching the goal (handing in a report/artefact/thesis)
- you're probably  _busy_! (other subjects, jobs, life!)

## The Weekly Status Meeting

**How it works:**

This is a **group** meeting, online, once per week. In each meeting you will be asked three questions:

1. What progress have you made?
2. What obstacles have you encountered?
3. What is your next step?

**Purpose:**

1. to gain an understanding of how everybody in the lab is going with their project
2. to determine if anybody requires individual meetings

Status meeting will be _only 30 minutes!_ (approx 3 minutes each!)

Does this look like _agile development?_ Ref: ([Hicks and Foster, 2010](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/score.pdf))

## On-demand Individual Meeting (<= 30 minutes)

**How it works:**

This is an **individual** meeting, either online or in-person. Book a time through Microsoft Bookings.

**Requirements:**

Will have a specific goal e.g.:

- talk about possible solutions to problem _X_
- fix technical issue _Y_
- discuss an ethics protocol
- analyse results to an experiment
- goal should be **SMART** (_Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound_)

Student and supervisor should know **exactly** what we are going to discuss. 

## Seminars 

**How it works:**

A group meeting for delivering information with relevance to multiple people. This will be **dual**-delivery! (both in-person and online).

**Examples:**

- how to structure a report/thesis in LaTeX
- how to structure a git repository for project delivery
- how to apply for an ethics protocol
- how to run a user study
- research topics in musical machine learning (mostly from [Creative Prediction](https://creativeprediction.xyz)
- research topics in sound and music computing (some overlap with [COMP2710 Laptop Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2710-lens/))
- research topics in interactive media (some overlap with [COMP1720 Art and Interaction Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/))

## Revision: **Three types** of meeting

- Status meeting: _just_ for updating status (not research)
- On-demand meeting: _just_ for discussing research (not status)
- Seminar: _just_ for 1-to-N information delivery (like this)

## The shape of a project

**Getting started**

- Defining research topic and objectives
- Background reading
- Finding your "unsolved problem"
- Discovering code frameworks and starting points.

**The Work**

- Coding up a system
- Iterating on a design
- Running experiments

**The Write-up**

- Expressing your process
- Analysing and discussing results
- Making images and plots
- Coming up with your _findings_ and _contributions_
- Writing documentation and packaging code

Your grade is based on a combination of your **written report**, **artefact**, and **presentations**.

Examiners look for your ability to:

understand and synthesise existing research

create an artefact, or code project skillfully, and explain it

perform experiments or critically engage with your research problem.

Your grade is **not** based on your results (really!) (see [Honours marking guidelines](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jks/Hons_May_17/Thesis_marking_guide.html))

If you get "good" results (yay!) but don't discuss them in detail, or critically engage in _why_ they are good, you won't do well. (and the converse)

## Project Planning

### A bad project plan

- **Getting started**: Weeks 1-9
- **The Work**: Weeks 10-11
- **The Write-up**: Week 12

### A better project plan

- **Getting started**: Weeks 1-6
- **The Work**: Weeks 3-10
- **The Write-up**: Week 6 and Weeks 9-12

# To help, here's some deadlines:

## 1-Semester Project

- End of week 6: Draft of report _Introduction_ and _Background_ sections (and draft code repository)
- End of week 8: Draft of report _System Design_ section (and draft code repository)
- Start of week 11: Draft full report

## 2-Semester Project.

- S1: End of week 6: Draft of report _Introduction_
- S1: End of week 8: Draft of report _Background_ section
- S1: End of week 11: Draft code repository and/or report _System Design_ sections
- S2: End of week 6: Draft of _Experimental Methodology_ and _Results_ sections
- S2: End of week 8: Full report, draft 1
- S2: End of week 11: Full report, draft 2
